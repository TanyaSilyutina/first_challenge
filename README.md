# Code Refactor

## Description

My 'Code Refactor' homework contained two files - HTML and CSS. I improved internal code in the two source files by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior so that the webpage could meet accessibility standards.

Please see a list of the changes I have implemented:

* Added semantic HTML elements
* Reorganized the elements to follow a logical HTML structure 
* Cleaned up the code by grouping elements into classes
* Added descriptive alt tags to images

After completing the assignment, I have a better understanding of how to use HTML semantic elements. I also practised my CSS skills and learned more about CSS elements.
