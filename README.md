# My first UW bootcamp homework

### While refactoring the HW code, I believe I have accomplished the below criteria:

* Added semantic HTML elements
* Moved the elements around the page so that they follow a logical structure 
* Cleaned up the code by grouping elements into classes
* Added descriptive alt tags to imgs
